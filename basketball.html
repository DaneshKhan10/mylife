<p><b>I love playing basketball. My position is point guard. I don't know who I would be without it. It isn't just a hobby. Basketball is part of me. I don't want to brag, but I've become a great player since I started. I don't let my height get in the way even though I am usually the shortest playing. When I'm on the court every problem in life goes away and there's no stress.</b></p><br />

<p><b>I am also a huge NBA fan. I'm a fan of the New York Knicks. Which makes my favorite player being Carmelo Anthony. He is the best player on the Knicks. He is my idol. My number one pet peeve is when people are bandwagon fans. I in opposition will always be a Knicks fan no matter how bad they are doing. They aren't doing so good as of right now but I am still a fan of them. I've been with them through thick and thin. I really hope they can win a championship before I die.</b></p>
