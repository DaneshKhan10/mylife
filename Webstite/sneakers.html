<p><b>I'm a huge sneaker collector. I have a hobby if collecting basketball sneakers that I think are really cool. I get my sneakers from Foot Locker and Champs. Sneakers are the way I express my self in clothing. It makes my outfits look really nice. I have almost every variety of colors so I can match them with anything. My favorite pair of sneakers I have are the Lebron 12 chromosomes. Those are the ones in the picture above. They are blue and pink and I think look really nice.<p></b>
